# CRUDyCucumber

This Project is to help me ensure that Cucumber Jelly (https://github.com/NickCharsley/CucumberJelly) is able to help test Netbeans Projects.

To some extent I'm following Geertjan Wielenga's instructions for **Loosely Coupled Reloadable Capabilities for CRUD Applications** https://dzone.com/articles/loosely-coupled-reloadable-capabilities , although On occasions I think he does jump some simple steps that I think are critical, but hopefully if you compare this to the articles there then you will get some of the pointers I could have done with.

Currently this has the compleat first Steps (Tagged Reloadable) and some tests.
