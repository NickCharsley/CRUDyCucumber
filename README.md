# CRUDyCucumber

This Project is to help me ensure that Cucumber Jelly (https://github.com/NickCharsley/CucumberJelly) is able to help test Netbeans Projects.

To some extent I'm following Geertjan Wielenga's instructions for **Loosely Coupled Reloadable Capabilities for CRUD Applications** https://dzone.com/articles/loosely-coupled-reloadable-capabilities , although On occasions I think he does jump some simple steps that I think are critical, but hopefully if you compare this to the articles there then you will get some of the pointers I could have done with.

Currently this has:
<ol>
<li>The compleat First Step (Tagged Reloadable), from https://dzone.com/articles/loosely-coupled-reloadable-capabilities.</li>
<li>The compleat Second Step (Tagged Savable), from https://dzone.com/articles/loosely-coupled-saveable-capabilities.</li>
<li>The compleat Third Step (Tagged Creatable), from https://dzone.com/articles/loosely-coupled-creatable-capabilities.
<li>Some Feature Files and Step Files to test the above (Tagged Savable-Tests).</li>
</ol>

N.B. In the articles between the Second and Third Steps Geertjan switches from the Derby Sample Database due to issues with saving. A later comment appears to indicate how to avoid this issue, so this is Continued with the customer database.
